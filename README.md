# Playground for comparing rendering speed
Recently I faced a problem with Next.js rendering speed and I wanted to compare the different rendering options. Goal of the repo is to compare different ways of rendering content and documenting the results.

## The problem
It's not unusual that excel file has 20 000 lines of data. Rendering the data with Next.js feels slow.

## The options
1. Next.js with SSR
2. Next.js with React Server Components
3. Next.js with CSR
4. GO & HTMX - TODO: and/or just GO?
5. Excel - TODO: is it worth it?
6. F# with Giraffe
